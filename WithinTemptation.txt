Truth be told, the first six months of the business, we focused on two things: One, was building great, functioning product teams. On that front, we have now shipped 10 titles in under a year (with two more pending). The other thing we focused on was doing stuff that we felt like we have something worthwhile to add to the mix.

In the case of eBooks, we’re parents and we’re writers. We are fortunate to have a great illustration and audio capabilities, anchored by a narrative and design sensibility. In the bigger picture, the goal is about getting to our “signature move,” and we feel like we’re well down that path.

The cat in the hat feels very lonely today.
It seems his friends have all gone away.
but he'll be alright, he'll go to the park
but then he looks outside and sees the clouds make it dark.

The cat in the hat feels very lonely today.
perhaps he'll go to the barn and roll in the hay.

Frozen

I can't feel my senses I just feel the cold All colors seem to fade away, I can't reach my soul

I would stop running, If knew there was a chance, It tears me apart to sacrifice it all but I'm forced to let go

Tell me I'm frozen but what can I do?, Can't tell the reasons I did it for you, When lies turn into truth I sacrificed for you, You say that I'm frozen but what can I do?

I can feel your sorrow, You won't forgive me, but I know you'll be all right

It tears me apart that you will never know but I have to let go

Tell me I'm frozen but what can I do? Can't tell the reasons I did it for you, When lies turn into truth I sacrificed for you, You say that I'm frozen but what can I do?

Everything will slip way
Shattered peaces will remain
When memories fade into emptiness
Only time will tell its tale
If it all has been in vain

I can't feel my senses
I just feel the cold
Frozen...
But what can I do ?
Frozen...
Tell me I'm frozen but what can I do?
Can't tell the reasons I did it for you
When lies turn into truth I sacrificed for you
You say that I'm frozen, frozen...
